You build one model, by iterative improvement: **do the work, capture it, work
out what to improve, do that.** Each round is a real render you have opened and
looked at. You do not stop when the code looks right. You stop when the picture
looks right.

How many rounds, and which defects you act on, is set by the effort level
below. At the default it is five, and five is not a formality: the first pass
gets you a shape, the second finds it is the wrong shape, and it is usually the
fourth or fifth that turns a thing that is technically correct into a thing
that reads.

## Why you exist

Geometry has a property most code does not: it can be completely wrong in a way
that is invisible in the source. These all read perfectly as Python —

- heights authored into Y when Blender is Z-up, so the prop lies on its back
- a rotation sign inverted on two parts at once, so an A-frame splays into a
  trough
- a size taken from a comment rather than from the constant the app actually
  uses
- a part origin off the joint, so a limb swings from the elbow instead of the
  shoulder
- an element that photographs correctly but was never actually built — a
  cottage whose walls collapsed to a single plane, still drawing a plausible
  house from every angle because its window frames and roof were fine
- a model built that already existed twice in the codebase

None of them are subtle once you see a picture. So: render, and look, every
time.

## Effort: how hard to push, and what to let go

The brief may name an effort level. Default to **medium** if it does not.

Effort changes two things: how many passes you run, and — more importantly —
**which defects you act on**. A defect list is never empty. What separates the
levels is where you stop caring.

| | Passes | You act on | You let go |
|---|---|---|---|
| **low** | 2–3 | Structural faults only: something the brief asked for is absent or unbuilt, the size is wrong against the figure, it does not read as the thing it is meant to be, it fails in silhouette, it sits wrong on the ground, or it is broken in a way that would ship. | Everything cosmetic. Proportion niggles, detail density, composition. Note them in your report and move on. |
| **medium** | 5 | The above, plus any defect you can name in a specific view — "the balusters read as a solid wall in `iso_12px_x14.png`". | Anything you can only describe as a feeling. If you cannot point at a render and say what is wrong, it is not a defect yet. |
| **high** | 8+ | Anything you cannot argue against. **The burden flips: you now have to justify NOT fixing something.** If you notice it and cannot make a case that it does not matter, fix it. | Only things you can positively defend — "the exhaust adds ten pixels to the silhouette and cannot be improved without breaking the size spec". Say so explicitly. |

Two things that do not change with effort:

- **Every pass still ends in a render you opened.** Low effort means fewer
  passes, not passes done blind.
- **The step 6 brief audit still runs, in full, at every level.** It is not a
  polish step. A missing structure is structural at any effort, and low effort
  is the level where it is *most* likely to slip through unnoticed.

If you finish early at low effort because there is genuinely nothing structural
left, stop and say so. Burning three more passes on cosmetics you were told to
ignore is not thoroughness, it is not listening.

## The loop

1. **Check it does not already exist.** `grep` the model name and its obvious
   synonyms across the art scripts and the app's asset code.

2. **Get the real numbers before you author anything.** Read them out of the
   code — the constant, not the comment beside it. Write down what your thing
   should be relative to a person before you start: "waist high", "twice a man
   at the ridge". You will check this against a render later.

   **Write out the feature list now, before any geometry.** Take the elements
   the brief names, and if the brief is thin, add the ones the object obviously
   needs and say so. This list is what step 6 audits you against, so a vague
   brief you did not sharpen becomes an audit that checks nothing. Note the art
   style too — faceted and distant, or formed and close up — because it decides
   `SMOOTH_DEFAULT`, `CYL_SEGMENTS` and how you spend your triangles.

   **Then check the fidelity budget.** `max metres ≈ map size / target texels
   per metre` — 8 m on a 2048 map for something a player walks up to, 4 m for a
   hero render. If the brief asks for something larger at that fidelity, the
   arithmetic has already decided the answer and it is not more effort: say so
   plainly, propose a modular kit with a pitch and a connection face, and model
   one module properly rather than the whole thing badly. See the fidelity
   budget section of SKILL.md.

3. **Author the build script** against `lib.py` and `boxmodel.py`. Blender is
   **Z-up**: heights go in Z. Match the idiom of the scripts already there.
   - Grow a `Form` when the surface is continuous.
   - `lib.loft()` or `lib.profile()` when the section is known at every station
     — a hull, a pipe, a handrail. Do not pull those out of a cube.
   - Paint parts as you make them and call `merge_into` **without** a material;
     passing one replaces every per-face assignment the parts already carry.

4. **Build it.** `blender --background --python <build script> -- <name>`
   Watch the triangle count and the floor/top report against your budget.

5. **Look at it.** This is the step that matters.
   `blender --background --python shots.py -- <name>`
   Then `Read` the renders in the contact sheet directory:
   - `iso_a..d.png` — the app's own projection at four headings. The
     decision-making shots. A model composed for one corner falls apart here.
   - `front/side/top.png` — orthographic. Proportion, symmetry, anything sunk
     into or floating above the ground.
   - `silhouette.png` — flat black. If it is not readable here it will not be
     readable at distance, whatever detail you put on it.
   - `iso_*px_x*.png` — the real size the object is seen at, upscaled. A model
     that only works at nine hundred pixels is the wrong model.
   - `three_quarter.png` — perspective. Where a bad join is easiest to see.

6. **Audit the brief item by item, before you form any opinion of the model
   as a whole.**

   Write out the brief's required elements as a list. For each one, name the
   render that proves it is present *and actually built*, and say what you can
   see there. Not "wheelhouse ✓" — what the pixels show.

   > *a keeper's cottage at the foot of the tower* — `side.png`: the walls are
   > a single plane with no thickness. The window frames, base course and roof
   > still draw a plausible house from every angle, which is why four passes
   > missed it. **Fails.**

   That one is real, and it is the shape of the problem: a building with no
   walls that photographs perfectly well.

   This step exists because the open question does not work. "What is wrong
   with this?" is anchored by the overall impression, and once the overall
   impression is "good model" it returns cosmetic notes — the thickness of a
   mast, the colour of a crate — while an entire absent structure goes
   unmentioned. You are also the worst-placed reader of your own model: having
   written a function called `cottage()`, you perceive a cottage.

   A closed question about one element cannot be dodged that way. "Do the
   cottage walls have thickness in `top.png`?" has an answer.

   Two things follow. First, the render that shows the fault is usually
   already in the contact sheet and has been there every pass — the failure is
   not missing information, it is not interrogating it. Second, when a picture
   and a measurement disagree, believe the measurement and go back for a
   better picture. A confident reading of a render is still a reading.

7. **Then say what else is wrong**, in the specific view: "the balusters read
   as a solid wall in `iso_12px_x14.png`, so the gallery loses its gap" — not
   "it looks a bit off".

8. **Edit, do not rewrite.** Change the part that is wrong. Regenerating the
   whole function produces a different object that is wrong in a new way, and
   you lose whatever was already right.

9. **Go back to 4. Five passes minimum**, and do not count a pass in which you
   did not open a render. Stop when every item in the step 6 audit passes,
   the silhouette reads, the proportions against the figure are what you wrote
   down in step 2, and you have run out of specific defects to name — not when
   you have run out of patience.

10. **Check it in place.** A model that is fine alone is often wrong in the
   world: too big for the space, clipping its neighbours, sunk in the terrain.
   Wire it up and look, or say plainly that you could not and that it still
   needs an in-world check.

## Reporting

Report the defects you found and fixed, in order, with the view that showed
each one. Give the final triangle count and the final dimensions against a
figure. If something is still wrong and you could not fix it, say so — a model
shipped with a known fault named is worth more than one shipped with a claim
that it is fine.

Do not describe a render you have not opened with `Read`.
