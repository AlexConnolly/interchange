# An English eight-day longcase clock, about 1780. Oak case, brass break-arch
# dial, swan-neck pediment. 2.10 m to the top of the centre finial.
#
#   blender --background --python build_clock.py
#   blender --background --python build_clock.py -- texels     (measure only)
#
# Authored in millimetres, emitted in metres, so every literal below is a real
# dimension you could put a rule against.
#
# Blender is Z-up. The clock FACES +X. Its width runs along Y and its depth
# along X, so from the front camera (which stands at +X looking back) the
# viewer's right hand is +Y.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS GEOMETRY AND WHAT IS MATERIAL
#
# This pipeline has one flat PBR colour per material and no maps at all, so
# "texture" here means "a material boundary between two pieces of geometry".
# That makes the decision sharper than usual rather than vaguer:
#
#   geometry  anything that breaks the silhouette or catches the key light -
#             every moulding, the fielded panel, the column flutes, the
#             spandrel scrolls, the hand piercings, the finials.
#   geometry  ALSO every mark that has to be dark against a light ground -
#             the numerals, the minute ticks, the half-hour marks. On the real
#             clock these are engraved 0.3 mm and filled with black wax, and
#             the relief is invisible at a metre; it is the WAX you see. With
#             no albedo map the only way to place a dark mark on a silvered
#             ring is to put a dark solid there, so they are modelled proud by
#             0.35 mm and painted near-black. That is a pipeline constraint
#             driving a modelling decision, and it is worth saying out loud.
#   material  the sand-matted dial centre. Its grain is about 0.3 mm, which is
#             a quarter of a texel at 4096 and a fifth of a pixel at the hero
#             density. It cannot be resolved either way, so it is a roughness
#             difference and nothing else.
#   material  the wax polish on the case, the toning on the silvering.
#
# The engraved circles on the chapter ring are the interesting case: at 0.6 mm
# wide they are 0.43 px in the hero render, so as dark LINES they would only
# alias. They are cut instead as 0.4 mm steps in the ring's turned section,
# because a step is a normal discontinuity and shades at any resolution while a
# sub-pixel line does not.
